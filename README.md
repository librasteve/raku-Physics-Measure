# raku-Physics-Measure
A set of SI, Imperial and US Unit objects that are employed by Measure objects having value, units and error(tbd) and act as operands in most calculations. Some prefix and physical constants included where needed. Some use of unicode and operator overload.

*NB. Feedback in general and on the [♎️] interface in particular is very welcome!*

# Synopsis
[https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Physics-Measure/bin/synopsis.raku](https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Physics-Measure/blob/master/bin/synopsis.raku)

```perl6
#!/usr/bin/env raku 
use lib '../lib';
use Physics::Unit;
use Physics::Measure;

#SYNOPSIS

#Unit objects can be selected or created with GetUnit:
	my Unit   $u  = GetUnit( 'm' );
# Define your own unit named "ff" (named args)
	my $ff = Unit.new( defn => 'furlong / fortnight', names => ['ff'] );

#Measure objects such as Length can be formally constructed:
	my Length $a .=new(value => 1e4, units => $u);	say "$a";		#10000 m

#The libra operator ♎️ is a handy way to construct objects...
    my $b ♎️ '5e1 m';								say "$b";		#50 m
    my $c ♎️ $a;									say "$c";		#10000 m
	my Length $l ♎️ 42;								say "$l";		#42 m
#...and to assign objects a value:
    $a ♎️ 3e1;          #'30 m'
    $a ♎️ '3 yards';    #'3 yards'
    $a ♎️ 5;            #'5 yards'
#...there is an ASCII version of <♎️> namely <libra> 

#To see what you have
    say $a.Real;        #50   or use $a in Real context (Real includes Int|Rat|Num etc)
    say $a.Str;         #50 m or use $a in Str context
    say "$a";           #50 m (values are rounded to 0.001 decimals by Str)

#The usual arithmetic operators < + - * / > and () brackets just work
#i.e. units and magnitudes are checked, calculated and errors are calculated automatically    
    $a ♎️ '4.3 m';      #'4.3 m' 
    $b ♎️ -2.3;         #'-2.3 m'
    $c = $a + $b;       #'2 m'
    $c = $a + '42 m';   #'46.3 m'
    $c = $b - $a;       #'-6.6 m'
    $c = '1 m' - $a;    #'-3.3 m' 
#Division like for like produces a Real value such as a Rat
    my Real $r = $a / $b; #'-1.869565'
#Multiply with & Divide by a Real imply a constant factor...
    $c = $b * 30;       #'-69 m'

#The Measure of Time has a raku Duration - i.e. the difference between two DateTime Instants:
    my $i1 = DateTime.now;
    my $i2 = DateTime.new( '2020-08-10T14:15:27.26Z' );
    my $i3 = DateTime.new( '2020-08-10T14:15:37.26Z' );
    my Duration $dur = $i3-$i2;

#Here's how to us the libra assignment operator ♎️ for Time...
    my Time $t1 ♎️ '5e1 s';     #50 s
    my Time $t2 ♎️ $dur;        #10 s
    my $t3 = $t1 + $t2;         #60 s
    my Time $t4 ♎️ '2 hours';   #2 hr
    $dur = $t4.Duration;		#7200

#Unit Conversion uses the .in() method - specify the new units as a String
    my Length $df ♎️ '12.0 feet';
    my $dm = $df.in( 'm' );				#3.658 m
       $dm = $df.in: <m> ;				#alternate form
    my Temperature $deg-c ♎️ '39 ºC';
    my $deg-k = $deg-c.in( 'K' );       #312.15 K
    my $deg-cr = $deg-k.in( 'ºC' );     #39 ºC
#Use arithmetic to get high order or inverse Unit types such as Area, Volume, Frequency, etc.
    my Area		  $x = $a * $a;         #18.49 m^2
    my Speed      $s = $a / $t2;        #0.43 m/s
    my Frequency  $f = 1  / $t2;        #0.1 Hz

#Use powers & roots in a similar way
    my Volume     $v = $a ** 3;         #79.507 m^3
    my Length	  $d = $v ** <1/3>;     #0.43 m

#About 230 built in units are included, for example...
    my $v2 ♎️ '7 yards^3';				#7 yard^3		(Volume)
    my $v3 = $v2.in( 'm3' );			#5.352 m^3		(Volume) 
    my $dsdt = $s / $t1;				#0.009 m/s^2	(Acceleration)
    my $sm ♎️ '70 mph';                 #70 mph			(Speed)
    my $fo ♎️ '27 kg m / s^2';			#27 N			(Force)
    my $en1 ♎️ '26 kg m^2 / s^2';		#26 J			(Energy)
    my $po ♎️ '25 kg m^2 / s^3';		#25 W			(Power)
    my $en2 = $po * $t1;                #1250 J			(Energy)
	say $po.canonical;					#25 m2.s-3.kg   (SI base units)
	say $po.pretty;						#25 m²⋅s⁻³⋅kg   (SI recommends)
	say ListBases(); say ListTypes(); say ListUnits();

#Measures can be converted to base type with the .rebase() method
    my $v4 = $v3.rebase;				#5.352 m^3
#Measures can be compared with $a cmp $b
    my $af = $a.in: 'feet';             #4.3 m => 14.108 feet
    say $af cmp $a;                     #Same
#Measures can be tested for equality with Numeric ==,!=
    say $af == $a;                      #True
    say $af != $a;                      #False
#Use string equality eq,ne to distinguish different units with same type  
    say $af eq $a;                      #False
    say $af ne $a;                      #True

#Colloquial terms or unicode superscripts can be used for powers in unitname declarations 
    #square, sq, squared, cubic, cubed
    #x¹ x² x³ x⁴ and x⁻¹ x⁻² x⁻³ x⁻⁴
